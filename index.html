            <h2>Family</h2><br>
            <p>I'm delighted to Family is with us from the very first second we are in the world. We cannot live in this world if our mother did not give birth to us. We also cannot be formed without the father.</p><br>

<p>
Parents are the family that gives us unforgivable love and care. There are many times that they will think more about our well-being than theirs. Brothers, uncles, aunts, grandfathers, and grandmothers are also part of the family who also provide tireless care for us.</p><br>

<p>
Apart from the love of parents, they are also willing to accompany us in various trials, celebrate in times of success, and be companions in our missions in life.</p><br>

<p>
And I am the one to pay attention to, so that I can introduce to my family, the Dumaog Family, a family full of love and unity, and we have proven it because we have experienced many hardships but it is by the mercy of God we have overcome, because of our help,
because it was our father and mother who were always there for us when we were struggling and I was very thankful because we had a father and mother like them.
</p><br>

<p>At the heart of our family are my parents, who have been the pillars of love, support, and guidance. They've instilled in us the values of respect, kindness, and determination. My father, a hardworking and compassionate man, leads our family with a steady hand. My mother, the epitome of grace and strength, ensures our home is a warm and welcoming place for all.</p><br>

<p>Let me introduce you to the incredible siblings who make up my immediate family. Firstly, there's my eldest sister, Rotchelyn, who's not just my sibling but also my source of inspiration and wisdom. He's the one I look up to for guidance and support.</p><br>

<p>Next is my second sister Ate Daisy Mae my second sister who is very beautiful and super kind when she is not angry but was not lucky in hight and she is also my idol because she is very strategic in life.</p><br>



<p>And my third brother is Kuya Arlo, one of my favorite e

enemies, and sometimes when we get along, it's too tender and my brother is also my idol when it comes to motorcycling because he's great when it comes to riding. in the motorcycle, when he is the one who is driving, it is better to pray.

<p>These friends, a diverse and fantastic bunch, bring laughter, support, and unforgettable memories into my life. They are the ones who've been there through thick and thin, offering unwavering support and love.</p><br>

<p>And then there's my best friend of nine years, a friendship that has stood the test of time. We've seen each other grow, celebrated successes, and comforted each other in times of need.
